# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Get a working linear regression model using data from different API's. Very simple, I'm out of time.

## Process
Aquire data from citybikes
extract required data
aquire data from yelp and forsquare
set up model 
pray it works

## Results
I obtained a lot more data than last time, after changing cities and starting to use yelp. 
Even so, I had an r2 score of .9, so I think it's safe to say this model is not good.

## Challenges 
I was very confused during most of the time I was alotted to work on it, and I still am confused on most parts. I had trouble with finding the main focus on this project, as well as why I should be using sqlite, as I already have my data sorted. 

## Future Goals
I should have asked for more assistance in many parts of this project, but my pride said otherwise. I am not proud of what I have done, as this is probably the worst example of my skills to date. In the future, I'm gonna ask more questions, and incorperate AI into my work to see if that can help me understand anything better.
